This is the second version of the MYtinerary project, the last project carried out during my training as developer at Ubiqum Code Academy, using the complete MERN stack.
It intends to be a touristic application, where the user might find cities to visit with itineraries to follow and activities to join. The user must register to access the cities list, and can favourite the itineraries or leave comments on them to share how they feel. 

It has rather improved since that time, using React hooks and context and in-line styling for the front-end, in a much more stable performance. 

As before, you will need the backend, made with NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB, all of which you can find at https://github.com/Ahmsanz/Mytin-back.

If you wish to give it a shot, you only need to clone the project. You will need:

    - Node and NPM installed.
    - Run NPM -i for installing all the dependencies.
    - Run NPM start to launch the front locally.

Enjoy! All feedback will be welcome!
