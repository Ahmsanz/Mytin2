This is the second version of the MYtinerary project, the last project carried out during my training as developer at Ubiqum Code Academy, using the complete MERN stack.
It intends to be a touristic application, where the user might find cities to visit with itineraries to follow and activities to join. The user must register to access the cities list, and can favourite the itineraries or leave comments on them to share how they feel. 

This is the back-end part, using NodeJS and ExpressJS to set the server and perform all the routing, connecting to the MongoDB database. 

As before, you will need the frontend, made with React, all of which you can find at https://github.com/Ahmsanz/Mytin-back.

If you wish to give it a shot, you only need to clone the project. You will need:

    - Node and NPM installed.
    - Run NPM -i for installing all the dependencies.
    - You will need to set some environmnet variables for the database urls, reflecting your local server.
    - Run NPM local to launch the server locally, via nodemon and dontenv. 

Enjoy! All feedback will be welcome!
